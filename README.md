# Epileptic-Seizure-Classification
This project aims to implement automated epileptic seizure detection and classification using the Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset (BEED). The goal is to build a machine learning pipeline that can distinguish between different types of seizures (Focal, Generalized) and healthy brain activity using EEG signal analysis.
